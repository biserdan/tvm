    Parameters
    ----------
    data : tvm.te.Tensor
        The input data to the operator.
    strides: list,
        strides of original conv2d -> extended to 4D due to strided slicing 
    weight_shape: list,

        Kernel layout required to check on weight shape    
    data_layout:str,
        Data layout of original conv2d required to interpret data shape
